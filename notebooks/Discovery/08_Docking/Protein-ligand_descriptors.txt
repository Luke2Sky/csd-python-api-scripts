The calculation of descriptors for protein-ligand complexes, such as are producted by GOLD docking, 
is described in the Hermes User Guide. In particular, see the following sections:

16      Defining Descriptors
17      Calculating and Using Descriptors
23.9    Calculating Descriptors for a Set of Docked Ligands
23.9.4  Running Descriptor Calculations via the Command Line
24      Appendix C: Calculating Descriptors: Computational Details
25      Appendix D: Using Descriptors Tutorial

An example of CLI usage on Windows would be:
 
& 'C:\Program Files\CCDC\Discovery_2021\Hermes\descriptor_calculator.exe' `
        -xml     .\descriptors.xml `
        -ligands .\gold_solns.mol2 `
        -csvout  .\descriptors.csv `
        -sdout   .\descriptors.sdf

Note that there is a Descriptors module in the API; however, it's emphasis is rather different.
It is described here: https://downloads.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/documentation/API/descriptive_docs/descriptors.html
