    "# Ligand Preparation for Covalent Docking\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the preparation of ligands for covalent docking with GOLD using a small set of acrylamide ligands to be docked into COVID-19 Main Protease (MPro). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important!** Currently, covalent docking cannot be fully configured using the API. We thus suggested that the docking is set up _via_ Hermes. Once a working configuration has been created, it can be used _via_ the API or the GOLD HPC tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Docking basics\n",
    "\n",
    "For optimal performance, GOLD requires good-quality 3D ligand structures as input (note that it only requires a single conformer as it performs flexible docking based on the input structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "In these documents, a '1D' structure means one where no meaningful 2D or 3D coordinates are present, whereas a '3D' structure is one where a realistic conformation is present. A '2D' structure would be one with a useful 2D depiction, but we are not really concerned with that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is assumed that the input structures are all in the desired charge and tautomeric states. No protonation/deprotonation or tautomer standardization/enumeration is done here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Covalent docking specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing ligands for covalent docking is more complicated that normal due to the way covalency is handled in GOLD. Familiarity with Section 5.6 of the GOLD User Guide, 'Setting Up Covalently Bound Ligands' is assumed in what follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 5.6.1, 'Method Used for Docking Covalently Bound Ligands', it is stated: \n",
    "\n",
    "> The program assumes that there is just one atom linking the ligand to the protein (e.g. the O in a serine residue). Both protein and ligand files are set up with the link atom included (so, if the serine O is the link atom, it will appear in both the protein and ligand input files). Ideally the link atom, in both the ligand and the protein, will have a free valence available through which the link can be made.\"\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Inside the GOLD least-squares fitting routine, the link atom in the ligand will be forced to fit\n",
    "onto the link atom in the protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a cysteine will be used as the nucleophilic residue, so the linker atom will be a sulphur instead of an oxygen. The same principles apply, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the link atom must be included in the ligands input to GOLD, the input structures must first be transformed into the adducted form. These structure are artificial, of course, as the protein is obviously not present and the linker atom must have an unfilled valence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the CCDC API does not currently provide facilities for chemical transformations, so we again recommend the use of RDKit (chemical reaction handling is described [here](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#chemical-reactions)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that 'chemical reaction' is used very loosley here: the transformations specified do not need to correspond to known chemical reactions. In addition, multiple reaction steps may compressed into a single step for conveniance. For example, the nucleophilic addition and keto-enol rearrangement step implicit in the reaction of a vinyl ketone moeity (as in an acrylamide) with a nucleophile (such as a protein thiol) can be compressed into one 'reaction' as is done below.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the molecules in this test set contain an unsubstituted vinyl ketone as part if the acrylamide (_i.e._ it is substituted only on the nitrogen). This is important as the reaction with the thiol will not introduce any new stereocentres into the molecule. If one or both carbons of the vinyl group are asymmetrically substituted then the adduct will contain one or two new chiral centres. This can certainly be handled withing this general framework but inevitably introduces some complexity. For simplicity we thus focus here on the unsubstituted case; a notebook discussing the effects of substitution of the vinyl group is available on request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is not an issue for the current example (due to the focus on the unsubtituted case), an important point to note is that the RDKit reaction SMARTS can be written with varying levels of strictness with regards to hydrogens. They can be written with exact hydrogen counts on all relevant atoms or written partially or wholly without hydrogens. In the latter case, RDKit must be relied upon to create valid molecules. It is generally good at this and the exceptions can be ususally be fixed using the [Chem.SanitizeMol](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdmolops.html?highlight=sanitizemol#rdkit.Chem.rdmolops.SanitizeMol) method. This method imposes little overhead and we use it routinely here to avoid any potential problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related issue is how tightly the reacting substructures are specified. Using SMARTs primitives for _e.g._ valence and total connectivities (as well as hydrogen counts) the reaction can be restricted to only well defined cases. This is generally desirable as it means the products will be well understood; loosely-defined reactions can lead to unexpected or multiple products, issues with stereocentres _etc_. The disadvantage is that more heterogeneous input sets might need several reactions in order to cover all cases. In general, I would recomment defining the reaction as tightly as necessary given the likely inputs. This can mean doing some preliminary exploratory work to determine the diversity present in the input set, which would probably consist of some combination of visualization inspection and substructure searches. Some brief examples of such validation are included below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another point is that the linker atom must have an 'unphysical' open valence, but that a chemically-valid molecule is required for the conformer generator. Our approach here is to use a 'chemical tag' on the thiol reactant whcih is easy to identify and remove in a final step. Astatine is used here as it is conveniently momovalent and accepted by the conformer generator but is highly unlikely to be present in the input mulecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes on the docking system\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional docking system is provided here for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protein target is derived from [5REN](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/5ren), which is SARS-CoV-2 (_i.e._ COVID-19) Main Protease with a fragment inhibitor covalently bound to the catalysic cysteine (Cys145). The file `target\\protein.mol2` was prepared by importing the PDBe structure into Hermes and performing basic protein-preparation steps using the GOLD Wizard (see the GOLD and Hermes User Guides and asociated CCDC tutorial materials for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the preparation of this demo system has not been performed thoroughly, _e.g._ Asn and Gln orientations and His tautomers and orientatations have not been investigated in any detail. This could be important here as there are His residues in and around the active site. Thus, while the provided system is suitable for demo purposes, it should not be considered suitable for production work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bound inhibitor was extracted and saved as `target\\ligand.mol2` for the purposes of cavity-definition only: it takes no other role in the docking. The ligand extraction leaves the bare linker S atom on the protein (Cys145.SG), as is required for covalent docking. \n",
    "\n",
    "When covalent docking multiple ligands with a common warhead, it is best to use a substructure file to define the linker: see Section 5.6.3, 'Setting Up Substructure-Based Covalent Links' in the GOLD User Guide for details. The substructure file must be in in `MOL2` format and contain appropriate Sybyl atom types. The file `substructure.mol2` provided with this example was generated from the simple example that is used below. This was exported from the notebook as a `MOL` file and loaded into Hermes, which causes Sybyl atom types to be assigned. These were visually inspected and found appropriate: the required substructure was then created by manually deleting the methyl substituents on the acrylamide N and exporting the the in the default format (_i.e._ `MOL2`). The atom index of the linker S atom was then noted and used in the setup of the docking in Hermes, as was the index of the common S atom in the protein (_i.e._ Cys145.SG).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.conf` files provided have settings suitable for a (medium throughput) virtual screen: again, it should not be used for production work without further efforts to establish it's suitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember that the ligands used in the example are just for illustrative purposes and are not claimed to be active!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Postprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be useful to export docking results as complete protein-ligand complexes, if, for example, further computations are to be performed. Howeever, the normal ways of making complexes do not quite work as expected for GOLD covlent dockings. This is explored further in the pair of companion notebooks [Covalent_Complexes-atom](02a_Covalent_Complexes-atom.ipynb) and [Covalent_Complexes-substructure](02b_Covalent_Complexes-substructure.ipynb)."
