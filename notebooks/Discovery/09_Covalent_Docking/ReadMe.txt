The notebook 'Ligand_Preparation_for_Covalent_Docking' illustrates the process of ligand-preparation for covalent docking with GOLD.

Also included here is a demonstration docking system based on Covid-19 MPro that can be used with the example ligands.

The 'Covalent_Complexes' notebooks illustrate post-processing of the docking to produce usable covalent complexes.
